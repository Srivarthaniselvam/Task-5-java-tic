 - If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Use the Program

# Setup:
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Clone the repository containing the Java file (TicTacToe.java).

# Compile and Run:
Open a command prompt/terminal in the directory where TicTacToe.java is located.
Compile the Java file using javac TicTacToe.java.
Run the compiled program with java TicTacToe.

# Gameplay:
